Original .exe is included into the repo, but still

How to build it:

Originally I used Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 to build it. I guess it's easy now to achieve the same using any version of Microsoft Visual Studio Express or even any other C/C++ IDE for Windows. I've done this using CodeBlocks one time.

The steps are:

0. Ensure you have DirectX SDK installed
1. Setup simple windows GUI project
2. Set "src/xetris.ico" as application icon
3. Add "src/saveloaddialog.rc" to project resources
4. Add all .h and .cpp files in "src" folder to the project
5. Add DXSDK "Include" and "Lib" folders to compiler and linker search paths
6. Setup linker dependencies: user32.lib gdi32.lib ddraw.lib dinput8.lib

I hope it would compile fine.
