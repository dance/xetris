Original .exe is included into the repo, but still

How to build it:

Originally I used Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 to build it. I guess it's easy now to achieve the same using any version of Microsoft Visual Studio Express or even any other C/C++ IDE for Windows. I've done this using CodeBlocks one time.

The steps are:

1. Setup simple windows GUI project
2. Add "src/xetris.ico" as application icon
3. Add "src/saveloaddialog.rc" to project resources
4. Add all .h and .cpp files in "src" folder
5. Setup linker dependencies: user32.lib gdi32.lib ddraw.lib dinput8.lib

I hope it would compile fine.
